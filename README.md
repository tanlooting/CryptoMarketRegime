Cryptocurrency Market Regime Classification

Current work uses python hmmlearn library and various information criteria (AIC, BIC and HQC) to identify the optimal number of states for the model to predict Ethereum's market regime.

Bitcoin and most financial time series have demonstrated volatility clusterings, and we hypothesized that Ethereum has the same behaviour. 

We used Aug 2017 to Aug 2021 data in current study and 5-states HMM model is found to have the best fit. Further studies include the investigation of different observation variables, qualitative assessment of each regimes etc.
